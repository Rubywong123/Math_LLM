There are 66 choices in total. 450 students suggested mashed potatoes. 38 suggested bacon. So 450 + 38 = 488. But the question asks for the number of students who participated, so we can't just add these two numbers together. Instead, we need to find out how many students did not participate. Since there were 66 choices, and 488 students suggested some type of food, that means 66 - 488 = -422 students did not participate. But that can't be right, because it's not possible to have a negative number of students. This means there must be some missing information in the question. Without knowing how many choices were left after mashed potatoes and bacon were suggested, we can't determine how many students participated.",

If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. There were 703 visitors on the previous day. That's 1 day. If there were 246 visitors on that day, then in total there were 703 + 246 = 949. The question asks for the number of visitors within 25 days. Since there were 949 visitors in 2 days, then in 25 days, there would be 949 \\* 25 / 2 = 11862.5. But the number of visitors must be a whole number. So it's not possible to calculate the exact number of visitors within 25 days.",

That doesn't make sense. Let's think again. There were 16 roses originally. Then there were 13 roses after Jessica cut some more. So she cut 16 - 13 = 3. That was the number of roses she cut. But we need to know how many orchids she cut. Let's look back at the question. It says that there are now 7 orchids. That means that there were 3 + 7 = 10 orchids in the vase. But there were originally only 3 orchids. So Jessica must have cut 3 - 10 = -7 orchids. That still doesn't make sense. Let's think again. The question says that Jessica cut some more roses and orchids. It doesn't say how many of each. Maybe she cut 3 roses and 7 orchids. That would make 3 + 7 = 10 flowers in all. And that would leave 16 - 3 = 13 roses. That would match the numbers in the question. The answer is 7 orchids.",

So there are 58 students in 87/58 = 1.5 classrooms. Since there can't be a fraction of a classroom, we'll round up to 2 students per classroom. So there are 2 students x 87 classrooms = 174 students. Since there are 2 seats on each school bus, there are 2 seats/student = 0.0115 school buses. Since there can't be a fraction of a school bus, we'll round up to 1 school bus. So there are 174 students / 2 seats/school bus = 87 school buses. The answer is 87.",

It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. The book had 41 chapters and each chapter had the same number of pages. It had a total of 450 pages. So each chapter had 450 / 41 \u2248 10.98. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a page, let's assume that each chapter has 11 pages. That would mean 41 chapters times 11 pages each is 451 pages. This is 1 more page than the book has, so we'll assume that the last chapter is incomplete and has only 10 pages. That would mean 40 chapters times 11 pages each is 440 pages. Adding the 10 pages from the last chapter would give us 450 pages. Now, if Frank read 450 pages in 30 days, then he read 450 / 30 = 15 pages per day. The answer is 15 pages.",

If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, which means Zachary did 56 less push-ups than David. So Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18. But you can't do negative push-ups. This question has a trick. It turns out that Zachary didn't do any push-ups. So David did 38 push-ups and Zachary did 0 push-ups. Altogether, 38 + 0 = 38. The answer is 38.",

The answer is 6.\n\nQuestion 2: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\nAnswer 2: Let's think step by step. There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive. 3 + 2 = 5. The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion 3: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\nAnswer 3: Let's think step by step. Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74.

How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\nAnswer 4: Let's think step by step. Jason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 - 12 = 8. The answer is 8.\n\nQuestion 5: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. There are 36 pickers. They fill 8 drums of grapes per day. So they fill 36 \\* 8 = 288 drums of grapes per day. To fill 240 drums, it will take them 240 / 288 = 0.8125 days. But since they can't fill a fraction of a drum, they will fill 240 drums in 1 day. The answer is 1.",

The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 24 + 33 = 57 inches. The mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 57 - 5 = 52 inches. The mouse jumped 52 - 24 = 28 inches farther than the grasshopper. The answer is 28.",

Then Jessica threw away 34. That means there were 21 - 34 = -13. But wait, there can't be negative roses! That means Jessica must have added 13 roses to the vase. Then there were 13 + 15 = 28. But the question says that there are now 15 roses in the vase. That means Jessica must have taken away 28 - 15 = 13. But the question asks how many roses she threw away more than those she cut. Since she didn't cut any roses, the answer is 13 - 0 = 13.",

The answer is 8.\n\nQuestion 5: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Mary already put in 4 cups of sugar. So she needs 9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour. She also needs 6 cups of sugar. But she already put in 4 cups of sugar. So she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more cups of sugar. The difference between 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar is 5 - 2 = 3. The answer is 3.",

If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. There were 512 visitors on the day in question. The previous day had 471 visitors. And 808 visitors came the day before that. That's a total of 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791. The question asks for the number of visitors within the past 89 days. Since we know the number of visitors for the past 3 days, we can calculate the number of visitors for the past 89 days. We can assume that the number of visitors for the remaining 86 days is the same as the average number of visitors for the past 3 days. The average number of visitors for the past 3 days is 1791 / 3 = 597. So the number of visitors for the past 89 days is 597 \\* 89 = 52943. The answer is 52943.",
