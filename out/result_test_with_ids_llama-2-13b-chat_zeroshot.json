If only 26 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut? \nAnswer: 15 students did not make the cut.\n\nStep by Step:\n\n1) 39 girls + 4 boys = 43 students\n\n2) 26 students were called back, so we subtract that from 43:\n\n43 - 26 = 17\n\n3) There were 17 students who did not make the cut.\n\n17 = 15 girls + 2 boys\n\nSo, there were 15 girls and 2 boys who did not make the cut.\n\nPlease note that this is a very simple example to help you understand the concept of \"subtraction\". In real life, you will have to deal with more complex situations and larger numbers. But the basic idea remains the same: you need to find the difference between two numbers by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one.",
