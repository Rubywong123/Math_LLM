If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make? \nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. Robin can make 23 / 6 = 3.83. But she can't make a fraction of a baggie. She can make 23 chocolate chip cookies into 3 full baggies and have 1 cookie left over. Similarly, she can make 25 / 6 = 4.17. But she can't make a fraction of a baggie. She can make 25 oatmeal cookies into 4 full baggies. In total, she can make 3 + 4 = 7 baggies. The answer is 7.",
