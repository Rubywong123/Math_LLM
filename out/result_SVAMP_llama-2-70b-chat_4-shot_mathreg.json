There are 692 girls. There are 458 more girls than boys. So there are 458 fewer boys than girls. Let's say there are x boys. So there are 692 - x girls. We know that the number of girls is 458 more than the number of boys. So we can write an equation: 692 - x = 458 + x. Simplify the equation: 692 - x = 458 + x. Subtract 458 from both sides: 234 = x. So there are 234 boys. Now we know that there are 692 girls and 234 boys. In total there are 692 + 234 = 926 pupils in that school. The answer is 926 .",
