Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nQuestion 3.1: How much money does Ali have in total?\nAnswer 3.1: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So he has 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars.\nQuestion 3.2: How much money does Ali give to his sister?\nAnswer 3.2: Ali gives half of the total money he has to his sister. So he gives 160 / 2 = 80 dollars to his sister.\nQuestion 3.3: How much money does Ali have after giving his sister the money?\nAnswer 3.3: After giving his sister the money, Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.\nQuestion 3.4: How much money does Ali use to buy dinner?\nAnswer 3.4: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner.

After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nQuestion 4.1: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.1: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters.\nQuestion 4.2: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.2: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.\n\nQuestion 5:  Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 14 bags, but didn't recycle 5 of them, how many points would she have earned? \nQuestion 5.1: How many points did Megan earn for each bag of cans?\nAnswer 5.1: Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled.\n\nQuestion 5.2: How many bags of cans did Megan recycle?\nAnswer 5.2: Megan had 14 bags of cans.\n\nQuestion 5.3: How many points did Megan earn in total?\nAnswer 5.3: Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. Therefore, she earned 14 * 8 = 112 points in total. The answer is 112.\n\nQuestion 5.4: Now we can answer the question: How many points would Megan have earned?\nAnswer 5.4: Megan didn't recycle 5 of the bags of cans. So she would have earned 112 points if she had recycled all 14 bags of cans. However, she only earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled. Therefore, she would have earned 112 / 8 = 14 points more than she actually earned. The answer is 14.",
