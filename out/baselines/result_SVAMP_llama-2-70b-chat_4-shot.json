If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total number of planks. We have 12 large planks and 10 small planks, so the total number of planks is 12 + 10 = 22. Next, we calculate the number of nails needed for each type of plank. For large planks, we need 15 nails. For small planks, we need 5 nails. So the total number of nails needed is 15 + 5 = 20.

How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\nAnswer 1: Let's think step by step. There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted.

If she still needs 12 more cups of flour How many cups of flour did she put in?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. Mary needs 13 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. So she only needs 13 - x cups of flour, where x is the number of cups she put in. We know that she needs 12 more cups of flour. So we can write an equation: 13 - x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 1.
