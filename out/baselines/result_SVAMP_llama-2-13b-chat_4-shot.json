If there are 6 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he remove from the shelf?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. Jerry started with 3 action figures. Then he added 4 more. So he had 3 + 4 = 7. Then he removed some of the old ones. So he had 7 - x, where x is the number of old action figures he removed. We know that there are 6 action figures on the shelf now. So we can set up the equation: 7 - x = 6. Solving for x gives us x = 1. Jerry removed 1 action figure from the shelf. The answer is 1.",

How many marbles did Doug lose?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. Ed started with 2 more marbles than Doug. So Ed had 2 more than Doug's original number of marbles. After losing some marbles, Doug now has fewer marbles. So Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Let's find out how many marbles Doug had before he lost any. 2 more than Doug's original number is 2 + Doug's original number. So we can set up an equation: 2 + Doug's original number = Ed's number of marbles. We know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So we can set up another equation: Ed's number of marbles = Doug's number of marbles + 19. Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for Doug's original number of marbles. Substitution works well here. We can substitute Ed's number of marbles into the first equation: 2 + Doug's original number = 19 + Doug's original number. This simplifies to: 2 + Doug's original number = 21. We can solve for Doug's original number: Doug's original number = 21 - 2 = 19. So Doug had 19 marbles before he lost any.",

There are 84 seats on each school bus. How many students are in each class?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. There are 24 classrooms. Each classroom has the same number of students, so there are 24 x 120 = 2880 students in total. Since each school bus can seat 84 students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus to get the number of students in each class. 2880 \u00f7 84 = 34.

The answer is 8.\n\nQuestion 5: There are 2 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 red peaches and some more green peaches. If there are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets How many green peaches are in each basket?\nAnswer 5: Let's think step by step. There are 2 baskets. Each basket has 4 red peaches. So there are 2 x 4 = 8 red peaches. And then there are some more green peaches. So the total number of peaches in both baskets is 8 + x, where x is the number of green peaches. We know that there are 12 peaches in all, so we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 12. Solving for x gives us x = 4. So there are 4 green peaches in each basket.",
