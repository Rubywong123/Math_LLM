If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make? \nAnswer 8: Let's think step by step. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time. If he needs to pick up 9 trays from one table, he will need to make 9 / 8 = 1.125 trips. If he needs to pick up 7 trays from another table, he will need to make 7 / 8 = 0.875 trips. So he will make 1.125 + 0.875 = 1.9 trips. The answer is 1.9.\n",
