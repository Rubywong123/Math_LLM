If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest? \nAnswer: The chef can cook the remaining 2 potatoes in 18 minutes.\nExplanation:  The chef has already cooked 7 potatoes, which means he has 2 more potatoes left to cook. Each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, so the chef needs to cook 2 potatoes in 6 minutes (3 minutes x 2 = 6 minutes). Therefore, it will take the chef 18 minutes to cook all 9 potatoes (3 minutes x 2 + 6 minutes = 18 minutes).",

If each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total? \nAnswer: The pet store has 32 birds.\nQuestion:  How did you arrive at this answer?\nAnswer:  We know that there are 4 bird cages, and each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets. So, the total number of parrots is 4 x 8 = 32. And, the total number of parakeets is 4 x 2 = 8. Therefore, the pet store has 32 + 8 = 40 birds in total.\nQuestion:  What if there were 16 parakeets instead of 2?\nAnswer:  If there were 16 parakeets instead of 2, then the total number of birds in the pet store would be 32 + 16 = 48 birds.\nQuestion:  What if there were 5 bird cages instead of 4?\nAnswer:  If there were 5 bird cages instead of 4, then the total number of birds in the pet store would be 5 x 8 = 40 birds (for the parrots). And, the total number of parakeets would be 5 x 2 = 10. Therefore, the pet store has 40 + 10 = 50 birds in total.\nQuestion:  What if there were 3 parakeets instead of 2?\nAnswer:  If there were 3 parakeets instead of 2, then the total number of birds in the pet store would be 32 + 3 = 35 birds.\nQuestion:  What if there were 7 parrots instead of 8?\nAnswer:  If there were 7 parrots instead of 8, then the total number of birds in the pet store would be 32 + 7 = 40 birds.\nQuestion:  What if there were 2 bird cages with 9 parrots and 1 parakeet in each cage?\nAnswer:  If there were 2 bird cages with 9 parrots and 1 parakeet in each cage, then the total number of birds in the pet store would be 2 x 9 = 18 birds (for the parrots). And, the total number of parakeets would be 2 x 1 = 2. Therefore, the pet store has",

If she sold 5 of them and then made 10 more, how many cupcakes would she have? \nAnswer: Maria would have 29 cupcakes. \nQuestion:  How did you get that answer? \nAnswer:  I used the information given in the question to calculate the total number of cupcakes Maria had. In the question, it says Maria made 19 cupcakes and sold 5 of them, so she had 19 - 5 = 14 cupcakes left. Then, it says she made 10 more cupcakes, so she had 14 + 10 = 24 cupcakes in total. Therefore, Maria had 24 cupcakes. \nQuestion:  Okay, that makes sense! But what if we want to know how many cupcakes Maria sold? \nAnswer:  To find out how many cupcakes Maria sold, we need to subtract the number of cupcakes she sold (5) from the total number of cupcakes she had (24). So, Maria sold 24 - 5 = 19 cupcakes.",

Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the total time needed to paint all 4 rooms is 4 x 5 = 20 hours. Since he has already painted 2 rooms, he has 20 - 2 = 18 hours left to paint the remaining 4 rooms. Therefore, he will take 1 hour less to paint the remaining rooms.",
